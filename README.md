<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

  <h3>Intake</h3>

  - The Intake is the first step to the osTicket lifecycle
  - It is where clients/customers put in a request to fix something that is broken or a problem
  - A user, in this case, Karen, will create a support ticket
      - NOTE: Any user within the organization (depending on the business policies) can create tickets to solve

  <h3>Assignment and Communication</h3>

  - Support Agent (John Doe) reads the ticket and issues the severity

  - If the ticket is unclear in severity, the agent will message the user (Karen) to get more information
  - Support Agent John will then assign the severity of the case depending on the company's SLA policies (Sev-A, Sev-B, Sev-C, etc) or reassign to someone else

  <h3>Working The Issue</h3>

  - While working the issue, John Doe realized that Jane Doe's expertise as a SysAdmin is better suited for the task, so he reassigns the ticket to her
  - Then, Jane Doe fixes the issue

  <h3>Resolution</h3>

  - At this point, the issue has been addressed and Jane Doe closes the ticket

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>From creating a ticket to communication between agents to solving the issue, this shows what a full online ticket cycle would look like</p>
  <p>This project serves as a foundation for any IT professional that works tickets daily. There will be many scenarios, and this is one of the many scenarios!</p>
